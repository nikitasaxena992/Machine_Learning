# Machine_Learning
 Arthur Samuel described machine learning as the feild of study that gives computer the ablility to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## Classification Of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement

### Supervised Learning : 
Supervised Learning is where we have input variable(x) and output variable (y) and we use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.
 Y = f(X)
 ### Algorithms.
